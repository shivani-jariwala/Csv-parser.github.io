## Problem Statement 
1. Write software that reads the CSV data (of books, magazines, and authors) given on
the next page.
2. Print out all books and magazines (on either console UI) with all their details (with a
meaningful output format).
3. Find a book or magazine by its ISBN.
4. Find all books and magazines by their authorsâ€™ email.
5. Print out all books and magazines with all their details sorted by title. This sort
should be done for books and magazines together.
6. Add a book and a magazine to the data structure of your software and export it to a
new CSV file.

## Notes
I've tried to cover all the above points and via api end point's.
I've made use of both Promises and async-await

To run them kindly follow the below steps
1. Clone the Repo
2. npm install
3. npm start and there you go, server has started!!
